I pledge that the work done here was my own and that I have learned how to write this program, such that I could throw it out and restart and finish it in a timely manner. I am not turning in any work that I cannot understand, describe, or recreate. I further acknowledge that I contributed substantially to all code handed in and vouch for its authenticity. (Gunmo)
